    <h1>48 Laws of Power</h1>

    <p>This book is fun. If you enjoy History and Psychology. It can be a little over the top at times
        but it can also reveal tactics of people in power. It can also help understand your own actions 
        based on natural psychological patterns.

    <h2>YouTube Audiobook</h2>

    <p>the audiobook isnt the full book but I really enjoy it's presentation and gives you main portions 
        of the books itself
