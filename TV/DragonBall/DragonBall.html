    <h1>DRAGON BALL</h1>

    <p>The Dragon Ball series is a lot of fun! I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z. Recently I went through and
        watched the entire Dragon Ball anime. I started with Dragon Ball Z which is probably my favorite. 
        Then I watched GT which was good too. Watched Super which has a bit of different animation than the 
        other series but it was neat seeing the Sayians take their powers to a new level. Then i went back to
        the beginning to watch the original Dragon Ball series which was fun to watch and see how the main 
        characters originated and were introduced. Finally I went through and watched all the Movies. Most of them
        were in Japanese so it was a neat experience hearing the voices for the different characters in the
        shows native tounge. It took a year but enjoyed the ride!
