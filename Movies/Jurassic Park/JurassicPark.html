        <h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
        <p> Oh boy, I can't even count how many times I've watched this movie. I was but a wee lad when it came out
            and it scared the heck out of me. I didn't get to see in theaters originally
            but when it came out on tv, I would hide in the kitchen and peak around the corner to watch. 
            Evnetually I overcame my fear and once I did I watched it all the time. We taped it on VHS and I 
            would watch it, rewind it, watch it, rewind it. It was great! I could probably even repeat most of
            the movie line for line as it plays. My favorite scene in all of movies is when the T-Rex steps
            out of the cage and roars, simply amazing!
        </p>
