    <h1>JUPITER</h1>

    <p>Jupiter is the the fifth closet planet to the sun
        it is the largest planet in our solar system. It is known for it's
        unique red spot, which is a giant storm swirling in the planets atmosphere.
        It has the most moons of all the planets and some are still being discovered.
        It even has rings although they are not as prominant as Saturns illustrius rings.
        Jupiter is the second brightest planet in the night sky behind Venus.
        It was the first planet I ever saw through a telescope and it's amazing!
