    <h1>Pluto</h1>

    <p>I know everyone has their own opinion on if Pluto is a planet or not. It doesn't have the same orbit
        like the other eight planets do. In addition there are several other similar objects to pluto that
        are also in the Kuiper Belt; Haumea, Makemake, Orcus and Quaoar. Ceres is also in same class as pluto
        as a dwarft planet, which is located in the astroid belt. Pluto is the largest of the known dwarf planets
        and easily most recognizable as it was considered the ninth planet from it's discovery until 2006.
