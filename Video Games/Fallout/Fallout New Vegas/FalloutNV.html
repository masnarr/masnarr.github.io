        <h1>Fallout New Vegas</h1>

        <p>New Vegas is another great installment of the Fallout Series. Fallout old west style. two of my 
            favorite things combined. The story was great, the mechanics were improved from Fallout 3. 
            Many people see this as the best of the Fallout series and it is great but I think from just 
            the originality of the Fallout 3 and it being my initial experience with the game puts New Vegas
            a little bit behind. Plus some of the copy paste of the buildings from Fallout 3 to New Vegas 
            was somewhat of a let down at times. It's a great game and in many ways an improvement from Fallout 3.
