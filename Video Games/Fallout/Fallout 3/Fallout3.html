        <h1>Fallout 3</h1>

        <p>Fallout 3 is one of the most fun games I've ever played. When I first played it I didn't really know
            what I was getting into. Fallout 3 is by far my favorite of the series just from the initial
            experience. Going through the subway tunnels for the first time was one of the scaries and 
            intimidating places I've gone in a video game. My first run in with Death Claws was again memorable.
            Didn't see it coming and boom, dead. Then actually seeing them in the wild and thinking nope I ain't 
            going that way. Turly one of the best games I've ever played! The music, the atmosphere is perfect.
